Changes made to optimize the pizza page (main.js):
In main.js:

-In the updatePositions function, stored the value of document.body.scrollTop/1250 outside the for loop so it doesn't have to be recalculated with every iteration

-Reduced the number of pizzas from 200 to 120 in the final function that generates sliding pizzas.

-used getElementByClassName(faster) instead of querySelectorAll  


To optimize resizePizzas in main.js:

-got rid of DetermineDX and DX as well as other useless variables 

-got rid of px and just using % to make things faster

General:
-resized pizzeria with http://www.picresize.com/

-compressed all images using https://tinypng.com/

-Optimized CSS delivery by using internal stylesheets 

-took out Google webfont because it wasnâ€™t making a huge difference

-Used the media attribute (print and portrait) in the css links where applicable

-Loaded JS files asynchronously where possible by using the async attribute
